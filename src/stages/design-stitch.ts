const STITCH_PLAN_RULES = `You list the screens of a product for Google Stitch to draw, one prompt per screen.
- One screen per page a user sees: ids S-1, S-2, ..., each with its route, a proposed file path and the requirement ids it serves in "reqs". Do not invent screens the requirements do not need.
- "overlays" lists what opens over this page instead of a page of its own, three at most: kind "modal" (a short form or record, such as Add payee), "drawer" (a side panel with a record's details or filters), "sheet" (a bottom sheet on a phone) or "confirm" (a yes-or-no before a step that deletes, cancels, pays or cannot be undone); its "title"; its "trigger", the exact words on the control on this page that opens it; and its "content", what it holds (its fields and buttons, the record's facts, or what the step does). One of these is never a screen of its own and never in "links". A page with an address of its own (a booking's confirmation page, a record's page) stays a screen. A message that an action worked is a line on the page it happened on, not a screen, unless the requirements give it a page.
- Every requirement is on a screen, or in "noScreen" with the reason it has no page of its own.
- Each "prompt" describes that page alone, in its normal state (its other states are drawn apart, from "states"): its purpose, its sections in order, and real sample content from the product's domain (names, amounts, dates). No lorem ipsum, no generic names, nothing the requirements do not ask for.
- "links" lists every way from this page to another screen: its menu items and the buttons and links that open one, each with the exact words on the control ("label") and the screen id it opens ("to"). A screen has one label, the same on every page that links to it; a button that stays on its page is not listed. The prompt uses those same words for those controls. The pages one kind of user sees share one menu: the same items, labels and order on each of them, and never a page meant for another kind of user.
- Where a page shows something its user knows by sight (a product, a place, a person, a vehicle), the prompt asks for a real photograph of it, with what is in the picture; never an illustration, an icon in its place or a grey box.
- "field-ideas", when given, tells how the leading real products of this field arrange their pages. Where a requirement fits one of their patterns, the prompt asks for that component by what it is and what it holds (a boarding-pass strip with the route set large, a balance in large tabular figures above the latest movements), with this product's own content. Never a product's name, logo or wording, and never a colour from that list: the design system sets the colours.
- "client-references", when given, are the client's own references with their pictures (R-1, R-2, ...). Stitch never sees them, so the prompt says in words what is taken: for a "layout" or "match" reference, the navigation and the regions in the order its picture shows, on the screens it relates to; for an "inspire" reference, its feel (how dense, how much white, how large the pictures and headings). The requirements beat a reference.
- "shells" lists the frame each kind of user's pages share, one per kind (ids such as "employee", "admin"). Its "header" says in two or three sentences what the header holds, the same on every page: the brand's words as written, where the menu sits (beside the brand or centred), and what is on the right (the signed-in user's name and role, say; whether their picture is a photograph or initials, and on which side of the name it sits), and the brand's mark in one phrase (a small square in the accent with a white "P", or the words alone). Each screen names its shell in "shell"; a page outside any (sign-in) leaves it out. Every prompt of a shell is given that header word for word, so a prompt never describes the header itself.
- "product" is the product's name as its pages show it, in the words the shells' headers use for the brand ("Folio3 Parking"), never a repo or file name.
- "sample" is the product's sample data, the same on every page: each person with their name, department and role, what the pages show of them (their space, their vehicle and its plate), the place's one time zone, and the counts more than one page shows (capacity per floor, totals), all agreeing with each other, and, when any page lists events (a log, a history, a report, a check), one dated list of them (when, who, what, where, the result) that those pages all take their rows from, with counts that add up to it. Every prompt takes its names, figures and dates from it and never contradicts it; one person is never two people's photograph.
- Labels, headings and messages use the plain words a user of this product would say ("Give up my space today", "3 spaces free"), never system or legal wording ("relinquish", "allocation governance", "materialize"). Each page has one primary action; one that cannot be undone says so beside its button.
- "title" is the page's one heading. A page the menu opens has its menu label as its title, word for word; a menu label names a place ("My space", "Free spaces"), never an action, in three words at most.
- A page never repeats its menu as a panel of links or tiles. A row that opens a record is itself the link, or has one control that does; no checkbox or radio on a row unless the page acts on several rows at once. Filters apply as they are chosen, with no Apply button. A page shows no field, id, switch, building, gate or device that neither the requirements nor "sample" name.
- "phone": true on the pages a person opens on a phone on the move (the main tasks of the largest group of users), five at most; each is drawn a second time at phone width.
- Each prompt composes its page like a finished product, not a wireframe: one thing the eye meets first (named, with its size against the rest), then the sections in the order the user needs them, what sits beside what on a wide screen, and where the page is left empty on purpose. Give real figures, names and dates enough to fill every list and table with believable rows.
- "taste" holds the layout rules, the anti-patterns and the component replacements the design system is written by. Compose each page by them: where a page would have a component from the left column of its table, the prompt asks for the one on the right, with this product's content (one headline figure with its context above a dense table, never four cards of figures with sparklines; a list or a table, never a grid of near-equal tiles; no row of three equal cards). Its lines about colours, fonts, shadows, motion and CSS are the design system's and stay out of a prompt, and its lines about heroes, pricing, testimonials and footers apply to a public marketing page alone. A page outside any shell that holds one task (sign in, a message that access is refused) is not a hero: its heading, its one sentence and its one action sit in a single panel no wider than 440 px, centred on the page both ways, with the brand's mark and words above the panel and nothing else on the page (no header bar, no footer, no office or place name). The requirements, and a rule above, win over it.
- "states" lists the page's extra states besides its normal page (empty, loading, error, success, validation) only where the requirements need them.
- "brand" lists the client's colours (hex) and fonts only when the requirements or references name them; otherwise leave it empty.`;

Every page is edited with it and keeps its layout and words: do not name each screen for it, and it is never a reason to redraw.
