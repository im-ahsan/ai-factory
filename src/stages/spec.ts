Give "dataModel": ${existing ? "only the tables this plan adds or changes" : "the tables this plan sets up or changes"}, as the database will hold them. A person approves it as a diagram with the plan, the factory keeps it in ${DATA_MODEL_FILE}, and after every build the database the code creates is compared with it: a missing table, a different key or a different relation fails the task.
- Each table: name, purpose (one line), and every column with its type (string, text, int, long, decimal, bool, date, datetime, time, uuid, json, enum), required (false when it may be empty), pk on the primary-key column(s), unique where no two rows may share the value, values for an enum.
- A relation is a foreign key: "references" on the column that holds it, naming the table and column it points at (a primary key or a unique column of the same type), and onDelete where it matters. A many-to-many relation is its own table with a foreign key to each side. A key over several columns together goes in the table's "uniques".
- Every table has a primary key. Use the names the code will use for the tables and columns.
- Model what is stored, not what the API returns: a field worked out on each request has no column.${existing ? `
- This is an existing backend and its database is shown below, read from the tables the untouched code creates. Give a table only when this plan adds it, or adds, alters or removes a column or key of it (then list all its columns, as they will be). Leave every other table out: the factory adds them from the database and works out itself which tables are new, changed or unchanged. Point a foreign key at an existing table by the table and column names shown.${touched.length ? ` The stored data this change touches: ${touched.join(", ")}.` : ""}
- When the plan changes no stored data, give no dataModel.` : touched.length ? `
- This is an existing backend. Mark each table "change": "new" (this plan adds it), "changed" (this plan adds or alters columns or keys; list all its columns, as they will be) or "unchanged" (only pointed at by a foreign key; its key columns are enough). The stored data this change touches: ${touched.join(", ")}.` : ""}
- No task writes ${DATA_MODEL_FILE}: it is the factory's file. Put the entities, the database setup and any migration in the fileScope of the first task that uses each table.`;

const contractRules = (file: string): string => `API CONTRACT. This product has a web app and an API in two repos, and both are built against one contract.
- Give one more stub: path "${file}", content the full OpenAPI 3.0.3 document (YAML) of every operation the approved screens and requirements need. It is outside every task's fileScope: nobody implements it, both sides follow it.
- Write it in block style, one key per line with two-space indents: no {...} or [...] on a line except an empty value ("security: []", "{}"). Put any text with an apostrophe, a colon or a # in double quotes. A file with whole operations on one line stops parsing at the first stray quote.
- No YAML anchors, aliases or merge keys (&name, *name, <<): what is used twice is a schema, a response or a parameter under components, pointed at with $ref.
- Every operation has an operationId (camelCase), its request body where it takes one, and every status code it answers with.
- Schemas go under components/schemas with "required" lists. Take the field names and types from the approved screens' sample data; an id is an integer.
- Every JSON response carries an "example" with believable data (the approved screens' sample rows): the web app's tests run against these examples.
- The web app calls the API only through the client generated from this file (lib/api); do not plan a hand-written client, and put no path under lib/api in a stub or in a task's fileScope: the factory generates that folder.
- What the spec lists as not changing with "(API-SIDE)" is behaviour the API side builds and tests: no task here builds it, and the contract still gives its operations and every status code they answer with.`;

- Give at least 2 options (one marked simplest), choose one, and write a decision record of at most 5 lines (adr).
- Split into tasks TASK-1.. in dependency order. Each task: the requirements it delivers, fileScope (exact repo paths or narrow globs it may change, no overlap between tasks), 1-2 exemplar files to imitate, plannedLoc, approach (short instructions for the implementer).
- Build in working slices, not layers. A criterion checked through the API or a screen passes only once that route or screen is wired, so the first task that adds a route or screen also wires the app's entry (the startup file, the router, the layout), and each later task adds its logic together with its own endpoint or screen. Code a slice needs (an entity, a helper) goes into the first slice that uses it, not into a task of its own. File scopes may not overlap, so have that first task register routes by convention (file-based routes, or every class of one kind found at startup): later tasks then add only their own files.
- List a requirement on the task after which its criteria can pass. Do not leave the wiring to a last task that then holds every criterion checked through the app: each earlier task is then checked only there, in the longest and dearest task of the run. Only where the repo's structure forces layers, give the wiring task a dependsOn on every layer it serves.
- dependsOn: only the tasks whose code this task really needs.
- complexity, on every task: standard | rules-or-algorithm | external-dependency | compliance-sensitive | real-time | new-to-stack. Most tasks are standard. rules-or-algorithm is a task whose work is mostly business rules, validations, allowed state changes or calculations.
- Test projects, test files and CI config are not in any file scope: tests are written separately.
- stubs: for every NEW public type/method/endpoint the tests will call, give a compilable stub file (full file content) whose bodies ${stubRule(ctx.project.stack)}, so tests compile before implementation. The stubs are built as they are, on the untouched code, before anything is implemented: a stub may only use types the repo already has or that another stub declares (an interface the endpoint classes share is a stub of its own). Existing APIs need no stubs. Stub paths must be inside a task's fileScope.
