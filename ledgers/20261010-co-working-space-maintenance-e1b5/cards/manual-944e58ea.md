# Check by hand before delivery (2 criteria)

Run 20261010-co-working-space-maintenance-e1b5 passed its automated tests and its review. These criteria have no automated test, so a person tries each one on commit 9afa7b76b9 and records the result.

## AC-12.1 (REQ-12)
- Given The API delivery is running.
- When A person opens the API origin in a browser.
- Then No maintenance-request screen is displayed.

## AC-13.1 (REQ-13)

- When A reviewer inspects the delivered application routes and repository artifacts.
- Then No screen or page for the web app is provided by this repository.

Your name is recorded with each result. The sign-off covers this commit only; a different one needs a new sign-off.
On the run page: the Tests tab. Or in your terminal:
  factory sign-off 20261010-co-working-space-maintenance-e1b5 944e58ea --pass AC-12.1,AC-13.1
  factory sign-off 20261010-co-working-space-maintenance-e1b5 944e58ea --fail AC-12.1 --note "what went wrong" --pass AC-13.1
A failed check parks the run: nothing is delivered until the code changes or the run is stopped.
