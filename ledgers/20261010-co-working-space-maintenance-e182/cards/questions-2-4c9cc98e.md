> # Co-working Space — Maintenance Requests
> 
> ## 1. Product Overview
> 
> A small web app for **Hive Works**, a single co-working space. People who work there report things that need fixing (a broken chair, a leaking tap, a dead light), and the front-desk manager moves each request from open to done.
> 
> This release is deliberately small: **2 screens**, one user, one kind of record. Sections 4 to 7 are the whole scope; nothing beyond them is wanted.
> 
> There is no existing application code. It is a web front end with a small API and a database behind it.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 2. Product Goals
> 
> - Report a problem in under a minute.
> - See at a glance what is open, in progress and done.
> - Keep the status of a request honest: it can only move in the allowed order.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 3. User
> 
> One already-signed-in demo user, **Sam Carter** (initials "SC"), who can do everything in this document. There is no sign-in screen and there are no roles.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 4. Data
> 
> ### 4.1 Request
> 
> | Field       | Rules                                                                            |
> | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | ID          | Set by the system                                                                |
> | Title       | Required, 3 to 80 characters                                                     |
> | Area        | Required, one of `Kitchen`, `Meeting room`, `Open desk`, `Washroom`, `Reception` |
> | Priority    | Required, one of `Low`, `Normal`, `Urgent`                                       |
> | Description | Optional, up to 500 characters                                                   |
> | Status      | One of `Open`, `In progress`, `Done`                                             |
> | Created     | Set by the system when the request is made                                       |
> 
> There is no other record type.
> 
> ### 4.2 Seed Data
> 
> The app ships with exactly 8 requests:
> 
> - 4 `Open` (one of them `Urgent`)
> - 2 `In progress`
> - 2 `Done`
> 
> Between them they use every area at least once.
> 
> ### 4.3 Persistence
> 
> Requests are stored in the database and survive a reload and a restart.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 5. Business Rules
> 
> 1. **Valid request** — A request needs a title of 3 to 80 characters, an area and a priority. A description, when given, is at most 500 characters. Anything else is rejected with a message naming the field.
> 2. **Starts open** — A new request always starts as `Open`.
> 3. **Status order** — The only allowed status changes are:
>    - `Open` → `In progress`
>    - `In progress` → `Done`
>    - `Done` → `Open` (reopen)
> 
>    Any other change is rejected.
> 
> 4. **Fixed after creation** — Title, area, priority and description cannot be changed after the request is made. Requests cannot be deleted.
> 
> The rules are enforced by the API, not only by the screens.
> 
> ### 5.1 API operations
> 
> The API needs these four operations and no others:
> 
> 1. List requests, optionally only those with one given status. Newest first.
> 2. Create a request.
> 3. Get one request by ID.
> 4. Change the status of one request.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 6. Screens
> 
> ### Screen 1 — Requests (home)
> 
> - Top bar: "Hive Works" wordmark and the user's initials.
> - Status filter with four choices: `All`, `Open`, `In progress`, `Done`. One is selected at a time; `All` is the default.
> - **New request** button.
> - List of requests, newest first. Each row shows: title, area, priority badge, status badge and created date (for example "8 Oct 2026").
> - Clicking a row opens Screen 2.
> 
> **New request dialog**
> 
> - Opened by the New request button.
> - Fields: Title, Area (select), Priority (select, default `Normal`), Description (multi-line).
> - Buttons: `Create` and `Cancel`.
> - A field that breaks rule 1 shows its message under the field, and the dialog stays open.
> - On success the dialog closes and the new request is at the top of the list.
> 
> **States**
> 
> - Loading: "Loading requests…"
> - Empty (no requests for the selected filter): "No requests here."
> - Error: "Could not load requests." with a `Retry` button.
> 
> ### Screen 2 — Request detail
> 
> - Back link to Screen 1.
> - Title, area, priority badge, status badge, created date and description (or "No description." when there is none).
> - One action button, depending on status:
> 
> | Status        | Button                                |
> | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
> | `Open`        | `Start work` (moves to `In progress`) |
> | `In progress` | `Mark done` (moves to `Done`)         |
> | `Done`        | `Reopen` (moves to `Open`)            |
> 
> - After the change, the status badge and the button show the new status.
> - If the change fails: "Could not update the request." The status shown stays as it was.
> - An ID that does not exist shows "Request not found." with a link back to Screen 1.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 7. Design Requirements
> 
> Clean and plain; a tidy internal tool.
> 
> - One light theme. No dark mode.
> - One brand colour for primary buttons, a neutral background, near-black text.
> - Status badges: `Open` blue, `In progress` amber, `Done` green. Priority `Urgent` red; `Low` and `Normal` neutral. Every badge shows its text, so colour is never the only signal.
> - One sans-serif font.
> - Works at 375 px wide (rows stack as cards) and at 1280 px wide (rows as a table). No horizontal page scroll.
> - Every field has a label, every control can be reached by keyboard, and text meets WCAG AA contrast.
> - No animation is required.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 8. Decisions Already Made
> 
> These are settled and need no question:
> 
> - No sign-in, no roles, no second user.
> - No editing or deleting a request.
> - No search, no sorting choices, no paging. The list shows every request for the selected filter.
> - No comments, attachments, assignees or due dates.
> - No notifications, email or live updates. The list is current when the page loads or the filter changes.
> - No optimistic updates and no undo: the screen changes after the API answers.
> - The created date is stored in UTC and shown as a date only, with no time and no timezone handling.
> - English only.
> - A double click on `Create` must not make two requests: the button is disabled while the request is being sent.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 9. Testing Requirements
> 
> Automated tests for the business rules:
> 
> - A valid request is created and starts as `Open`.
> - A request with a missing or too-short title, a missing area or a too-long description is rejected.
> - Each of the three allowed status changes works.
> - A status change outside the allowed order is rejected.
> - The list filtered by a status returns only requests with that status, newest first.
> - An unknown ID is answered as not found.
> 
> Plus one end-to-end test: open the list → create a request → see it at the top → open it → Start work → Mark done → filter by `Done` and see it there.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 10. Acceptance Criteria Examples
> 
> **Create**
> 
> Given the New request dialog is open,
> When the user enters the title "Kitchen tap is leaking", area `Kitchen`, priority `Urgent` and clicks `Create`,
> Then the dialog closes and the request is first in the list with status `Open`.
> 
> **Validation**
> 
> Given the New request dialog is open,
> When the user clicks `Create` with a title of 2 characters,
> Then the dialog stays open and the Title field shows "Title must be 3 to 80 characters."
> 
> **Status order**
> 
> Given a request with status `Open`,
> When a change straight to `Done` is sent to the API,
> Then it is rejected and the status stays `Open`.
> 
> **Filter**
> 
> Given the seed data,
> When the user selects the `In progress` filter,
> Then exactly 2 requests are listed.
> 
> **Not found**
> 
> Given no request has the ID in the address,
> When Screen 2 opens,
> Then it shows "Request not found."
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 11. Final Scope Summary
> 
> Two screens over one record type:
> 
> 1. **Requests** — a filtered list and a dialog to create a request.
> 2. **Request detail** — the request and one button that moves its status forward or reopens it.
> 
> Four API operations, four business rules, 8 seeded requests, one light theme.

**Q-4** How should surrounding whitespace in a title affect requiredness, length validation, and the stored title?
  A. Trim surrounding whitespace before validating and storing the title.   ← recommended: This gives “required” a clear meaning and avoids saving titles padded with whitespace.
  B. Count and store the title exactly as entered, with whitespace counting toward its length.
  C. Reject titles containing only whitespace, but otherwise count and store exactly as entered.
  (why it matters: This determines which create requests are accepted and what title data is stored.)

**Q-5** After a successful status change on the detail screen, what should happen to the Requests list when the user returns to it?
  A. Keep the selected filter and refresh the list; the request may disappear if it no longer matches the filter.   ← recommended: This keeps the list current without changing the user's filter choice.
  B. Reset the filter to All and refresh the list.
  C. Keep the selected filter and show the previous list until the user changes the filter or reloads.
  (why it matters: The choice changes what the user sees after a status transition.)
