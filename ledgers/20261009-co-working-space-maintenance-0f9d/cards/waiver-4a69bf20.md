A waiver is recorded with your name and reason. It covers these gates for this commit only; a different one needs a new decision.
To accept it as it stands:
  factory waive 20261009-co-working-space-maintenance-0f9d 4a69bf20 --reason "why this is fine"
To fix it instead: change the screens' containers or the design (factory design change 20261009-co-working-space-maintenance-0f9d), then build again. The pictures and findings are on the run's Design tab (factory design fidelity 20261009-co-working-space-maintenance-0f9d).
